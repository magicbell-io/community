Once you are up and running with the Inbox, MagicBell offers several ways to improve the notification experience for your users and team.

## Keep Building

- Avoid duplicate notifications on [Delivery Channels](/docs/channels) with [Smart Delivery](/docs/smart-delivery)
- Use [Categories](/docs/categories) to offer granular notification preferences to users.
- Style your notifications with [Email Layouts](/docs//email-layouts) and [Templates](/templates) per channnel.
- Use [Topics](/docs/topics) to subscribe users to notifications for state-less backend integration.

## Go live

- Ensure that you have [selected the correct user identifier](docs/choosing-an-identifier) based on your business domain.
- [Enable HMAC authentication](/docs/hmac-authentication) when you are ready to go live.
