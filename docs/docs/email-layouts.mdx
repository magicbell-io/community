Email layouts are a great way to add HTML content around your notifications, like a header or a footer. They apply to all notifications sent through the email channel.

Nota bene, if you are using templates in your email provider (via [overrides](/docs/overrides#provider-overrides)), all the rendering happens there and the email layout is ignored.

## How to compose email layouts

Please visit the Settings tab in the dashboard, then select Email Layout. Here you can specify your layout according to the following rules.

When the email layout is left empty, email notifications will render either:

- `{{ notification.content }}` for uncategorized notifications or categories without a channel template
- the [channel template](/docs/templates) when a [category](/docs/categories) is specified and an email channel template is defined for that category

If the email layout is specified, you can use HTML and the `{{ template.content }}` merge tag, which is replaced by either the notification content or the rendered channel template as explained above.

<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/email-layout.png"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>

At this time, one email layout can be configured per project.
