title: Email Layouts
---

Email layouts are a great way to add HTML content around your notifications, like a header or a footer.
They apply to all notifications sent through the email channel.

If you use template in your email provider (via [overrides](/docs/overrides#provider-overrides)),
all the rendering happens there, and MagicBell ignores the layout and any templates.

## How to compose email layouts

Go to **Settings &rarr; Channels** and select **Edit Layout** under the Email channel.
Here you can specify your layout according to the following rules.

When the email layout is left empty, email notifications will render either:

- `{{ notification.content }}` for uncategorized notifications or categories without a channel template
- the [channel template](/docs/templates), when a [category](/docs/categories) is specified, and an email
  channel template defined for that category

If the email layout is specified, you can use HTML and the `{{ template.content }}` merge tag,
which is replaced by either the notification content or the rendered channel template, as explained above.

<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/email-layout-navigation.png"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>
<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/email-layout.png"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>

You can set up one email layout per project.
