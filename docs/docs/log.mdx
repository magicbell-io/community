subtitle: How to view and debug sent notifications
---

The Logs page in the MagicBell dashboard shows a near real-time events feed of notification deliveries. You can debug any issues, by looking at the request body, response status code, response body, and other attributes, from both the Inbox, as well as any third-party providers.

You can use [the logs API endpoint]() to access this data, and use it in your dashboards or code!
