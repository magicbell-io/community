subtitle: Send more granular notifications with topic and subscriptions
---

While a [category](/docs/categories) lets you specify the type of notification,
a topic enables you to model a specific object in your app's domain.
For example, a social network deals with users, posts, and images and sends notifications
on particular posts, comment threads, or pictures. `Topic` represents a uniquely identifiable entity,
like a `Post with ID 123` a user with email `peter@piedpiper.com`, or even a `tag #hiphop`.

The social network could send multiple notifications about the `post with ID 123`,
across different categories like`comment` or `like`. You can see where this is going!
Notifications from the same topic (and category) should thread in an email client
or be batched up in the in-app inbox (ex: Julie and three others commented on your latest pic).
With topics, you would have a way to be specific (and precise) when grouping things.
As long as you find a unique identifier for something, you can model it as a topic!

Topics also enable

- The ability to notify all subscribers of a topic. This allows you to build a more stateless notification system by subscribing users when it makes sense and not having to build a recipient list when sending notifications.
- Follow/unfollow or watch/unwatch functionality in your front end. You can easily build something like the GitHub Watch button (with category-level granularity) or the Youtube Subscribe button.
- `matches` for specifying recipients using a SQL-like syntax.
- `unsubscribe_url` in Templates.
- Inline display of notifications in the topic view in your application.

Some upcoming features that topics will power

- Threading in email clients
- An ability to yank all or expired notifications from in-app and mobile channels.
- Batched notifications are sent to a specific topic/category.
