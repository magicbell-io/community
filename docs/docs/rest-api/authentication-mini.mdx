## Authentication

The MagicBell REST API utilizes an HTTP header based authentication using your
MagicBell's project's API key and secret. Your MagicBell project's API key and
secret are available in the "Settings" section of your MagicBell Admin
Dashboard. Please see the [authentication page](/docs/api-authentication).
