subtitle: Learn how to use the MagicBell REST API
---

This section describes the resources that make up the official MagicBell REST
API. Use it to send notifications to your users and retrieve notifications
previously sent to a user, change their state, delete them, etc.

The API is hosted at `https://api.magicbell.com`. It utilizes standard HTTP response codes and returns JSON responses.

The MagicBell REST API is described in an OpenAPI 3.0 document. [Download the OpenAPI Spec from our public repository on Github](https://github.com/magicbell-io/public/blob/main/openapi/spec/openapi.json)

## Client errors

The MagicBell REST API utilizes [HTTP response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
to indicate the success or failure of an API request. A `2xx` response code
indicates success, and a `4xx` response code means that the API request is
incorrect (like when a required parameter is missing or a resource, like a user,
could not be found). A `5xx` response code indicates an error in MagicBell's
servers. These are rare, and we always act quickly to solve them.

When the API responds with a `4xx` response code, the response body includes an
array that contains all the errors that have happened. For example:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "api_secret_not_provided",
      "message": "API Secret not provided"
    }
  ]
}
```

As shown above, some errors also have a `code` that briefly describes the error
that has happened. These are the possible error codes:

- `api_key_not_provided`
- `incorrect_api_key`
- `api_secret_not_provided`
- `api_secret_is_incorrect`
- `forbidden`
- `neither_user_hmac_nor_api_secret_provided`
- `user_email_not_provided`

You can handle these errors and take necessary action, like displaying an
appropriate error message to the users or reporting the event to your error
tracker. For example:

```js title=Node
const axios = require('axios');

const headers = {
  'X-MAGICBELL-API-SECRET': 'MAGICBELL_API_SECRET',
  'X-MAGICBELL-API-KEY': 'MAGICBELL_API_KEY',
};

const data = {
  notification: {
    title: "We're processing your order",
  },
};

axios.post('https://api.magicbell.com/notifications', data, headers).catch((error) => {
  const { response } = error;
  ErrorTracker.notify(response.data, response.status);
});
```

## Timestamps

All timestamps returned by the REST API are in seconds since the Unix epoch.

## Rate limiting

The REST API imposes a limit of 100 requests per second for most `GET/OPTIONS/HEAD` endpoints
and 60 requests/per second for `POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE` endpoints.
You will get an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response if you send requests fasters than that,
often accompanied by a helpful error message explaining the limit you have hit.
Unless you are on an Enterprise plan, these limits are subject to change without announcement.

Many of our API endpoints support bulk operations, and we recommend using them to reduce the number of requests you make.

## Idempotent requests

The API supports idempotent requests to prevent the same operation from being performed twice for some endpoints.
If you attempt an operation twice or more, we will process only the first attempt. For example, suppose a request to create a notification does not respond due to a network connection error. In that case, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key and it will create no additional notification.

To perform an idempotent request, you need to add an `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header on the request.
An idempotency key is a unique value generated on your side, which the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request.
We suggest using V4 UUID to avoid collisions.

The resulting status code and body of the first request will be cached. Subsequent requests with the same
idempotency key will return the same result. The cached results will expire after 24 hours.
