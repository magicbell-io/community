The Compose page, in the [MagicBell dashboard](https://app.magicbell.com) lets you send notifications to selected users or every user in your MagicBell user list.

It is a great way to test-drive MagicBell when you are getting started!

## How-to

All we need are a few details.

### Recipients

Type in or select recipients with their email. If you type in a new email, we will create a new user record automatically.
You can select `everyone` to notify your entire user base.

<br />

<Note>
  The users list (and `everyone`) is all the users [created using the users
  API](/docs/rest-api/reference#create-a-user) or previously notified. You can see the
  entire list on the Users page.
</Note>

### Title

The title will be the subject of emails, and the first, bolded line for in-app
notifications.

### Content

Content is the body of your notification - the message you want to pass onto
users. Content will be the body of an email and below the notification title for
in-app notifications.

The content input supports HTML. You can insert a header, image, and other HTML
tags. You can generate HTML for rich notifications [on this page](https://html-online.com/editor/).

### Category

[Categories](/docs/categories) control the delivery channels that the notification will be delivered on,
as well as the [template for different channels](http://localhost:3000/docs/templates). It is an optional input.

### Action URL

Clicking the notification directs the user to the action URL. It is an optional input.
