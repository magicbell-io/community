title: GraphQL API [Deprecated]
---

<Note>
  The GraphQL API will not receive any new updates or features, and will be sunset in the
  future, with a six months heads-up.
</Note>

<br />

If you are starting out with MagicBell, please use [The REST API](https://www.magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/overview).

If you are already using the GraphQL API and need help, the endpoint supports introspection.
