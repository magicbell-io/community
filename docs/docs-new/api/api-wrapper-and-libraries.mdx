title: API Wrappers and Libraries
---

Apart from our [REST API](/docs/rest-api/reference), we offer API wrappers in several programming languages. If you'd like to see a wrapper in your favorite programming language, please let us know!

We also provide libraries in popular frameworks that you can use to customize your MagicBell or build your own.

## Officially supported

### Node.js

[github](https://github.com/magicbell-io/magicbell-js/tree/main/packages/magicbell) [npm](https://npmjs.com/magicbell)

This is our new Node library to replace [@magicbell/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/core) module. It provides convenient access to the MagicBell REST API for applications written in Node.js. It includes methods for all our REST endpoints, and convenient HMAC and pagination helpers.

```
npm install magicbell
```

### React

[github](https://github.com/magicbell-io/magicbell-js/tree/main/packages/react) [npm](https://npmjs.com/@magicbell/magicbell-react)

This SDK contains React components to build a notification inbox for your site powered by MagicBell. It contains ready to use components, and provides the option to customize them.

```
npm install @magicbell/magicbell-react
```

### React Headless

[github](https://github.com/magicbell-io/magicbell-js/tree/main/packages/react-headless) [npm](https://npmjs.com/@magicbell/react-headless)

If you're building with React, but need a fully customized experience, this is the package to go with. It exposes the (headless) hooks on which `@magicbell/magicbell-react` was build.

```
npm install @magicbell/react-headless
```

### Ruby

[github](https://github.com/magicbell-io/magicbell-ruby)

This library provides convenient access to the MagicBell REST API from applications written in Ruby. It includes helpers for creating notifications, fetching them, and calculating the HMAC for a user.

```
gem install magicbell
```

### iOS (Swift)

[github](https://github.com/magicbell-io/magicbell-swift)

Our official iOS SDK is written in Swift. It provides a convenient way to integrate MagicBell into your iOS app. The SDK offers realtime updates, low-level wrappers for the MagicBell API, and support for the [Combine framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine).

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/magicbell-io/magicbell-swift", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
```

### Android (Kotlin)

[github](https://github.com/magicbell-io/magicbell-android)

Our official Android SDK is written in Kotlin. It provides a convenient way to integrate MagicBell into your Android app. The SDK offers realtime updates, low-level wrappers for the MagicBell API, and support for the [Compose framework](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

```
implementation 'com.magicbell:magicbell-sdk:1.0.0'
implementation 'com.magicbell:magicbell-sdk-compose:1.0.0'
```

You will find more information in the Guides section about how to use these.
